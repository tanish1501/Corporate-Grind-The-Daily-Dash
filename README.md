# Corporate-Grind-The-Daily-Dash
It is a humorous and fast-paced game that transforms the routine life of an average-paid corporate employee into a series of wild mini-game challenges. From brushing teeth like a timed rhythm game, solving a maze to catch the bus, dodging the boss’s scoldings with quick reflexes, to navigating petty family quarrels like a puzzle—every mundane moment becomes a chaotic test of skill and speed.

It’s a quirky take on everyday life where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and the daily grind turns into a hilarious race against the clock.
The project was completed using mostly HTML and CSS. Being our first ever project, we took some help from Copilot and used Canva to create cut scenes between games
This game lingers on the question of the daily boring life chores and whether you do it as a task or act as if it was a lovely game.
